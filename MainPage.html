        </p>
        <div class="align">
            <p><b>2.1 India’s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023:</b> This Act represents a comprehensive framework for personal data protection in India, emphasising consent-based data processing. It requires organisations to obtain explicit and informed consent before collecting and using personal data. The Act grants individual’s robust rights, including the ability to access, correct, and request the deletion of their data. Additionally, the DPDP Act addresses cross-border data transfers, imposing stringent conditions to ensure that personal data is protected even when transferred outside India. Non-compliance with the DPDP Act can result in significant penalties.
            </p>

            <p><b>2.2 Information Technology Act, 2000:</b> As one of India's foundational cyber laws, the Information Technology Act, 2000, governs the processing, protection, and handling of personal and sensitive personal data. This Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by ensuring that digital transactions are secure and reliable. It also sets out penalties for various cybercrimes, including unauthorised access to personal data and data breaches.
            </p>

            <p><b>2.3 Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011:</b> These rules, issued under the IT Act, outline the specific guidelines for the collection, storage, and processing of sensitive personal information. They require organisations to implement reasonable security practices to protect personal data, such as encryption, secure access controls, and regular security audits. The rules also mandate that organisations obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting sensitive personal data, such as financial information, health records, and biometric data.
            </p>

            <p><b>2.4 Indian Contract Act, 1872:</b> This Act forms the backbone of contractual law in India, including contracts entered into digitally. It ensures that all agreements, including those related to the collection and processing of personal data, are legally valid and enforceable. The Indian Contract Act mandates that consent must be free, informed, and obtained without coercion for any contract, including those involving data processing.
            </p>

            <p><b>2.7 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (as amended):</b> The Indian Penal Code addresses criminal liabilities for various offences, including those related to unauthorised access to computer systems and data breaches. Amendments to the IPC have introduced provisions specifically targeting cybercrimes, ensuring that individuals and organisations responsible for data breaches or unauthorised access are held accountable under criminal law.
